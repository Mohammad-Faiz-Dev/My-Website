# 💼 My Portfolio Website (V-2.3)

A fully responsive, minimalistic, dark-mode-enabled portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It features multiple pages — **Home, Projects, Resume, Skills, About, and Contact** — all styled with consistent layouts, theme logic, and enhancements for accessibility and responsiveness.
